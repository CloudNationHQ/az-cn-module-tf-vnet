This example highlights the utilization of service endpoints on subnets. They enhance the security by restricting access to a subnet, effectively providing targeted connectivity. This becomes invaluable in scenarios where certain resources should be accessed solely from specific subnets.

## Usage

```hcl
module "network" {
  source = "github.com/cloudnationhq/az-cn-module-tf-vnet"

  naming = local.naming

  vnet = {
    name          = module.naming.virtual_network.name
    location      = module.rg.groups.demo.location
    resourcegroup = module.rg.groups.demo.name
    cidr          = ["10.18.0.0/16"]

    subnets = {
      demo = {
        cidr = ["10.18.3.0/24"]
        endpoints = [
          "Microsoft.Storage",
          "Microsoft.Sql"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
